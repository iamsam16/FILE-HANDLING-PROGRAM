*DESCRIBTION OF THIS CODE*:
This C program demonstrates essential file handling operations, including creating, writing, reading, and appending data to a text file using standard C functions from the stdio.h and stdlib.h libraries. It uses a file pointer (FILE *fp) and functions like fopen(), fgets(), fputs(), and fclose() to interact with the file named "example.txt". The program first creates or overwrites the file and writes user input to it, then reads and displays its content. Next, it allows the user to append additional data and finally shows the updated content of the file. This program can be developed and run on any C-supported platform like Windows, Linux, or macOS using editors and IDEs such as Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Visual Studio, or GCC with a terminal. It is especially useful in practical applications like building text editors, maintaining logs, handling user input data, or managing configuration and report files. This program serves as a foundational example for understanding how to store, retrieve, and modify data in real-world applications through file operations in the C programming language.
